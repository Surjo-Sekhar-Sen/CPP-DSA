For running the code in your terminal:-
(1). First type g++ filename.cpp and press enter..
(2). Then run the code by typing .\a.exe
Well when you run the first one..it basically compiles the code and creates a file a.exe in the same folder you are in..and in the next line we basically run the a.exe file by .\a.exe
